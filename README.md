# CS492 Final Project
### Group 38: Garrett Martin, Conner Rhea, Garrett Smith, Alex Yu

### Best practice here is to create a branch that you work in and then merge into the master as you finish whatever task/thing you're working on
### Additionally do you best to pull from the master every time you sit down and commit when you're done so we don't duplicate efforts or create merge errors on accident.

To-Do:

- ProfileService
    - Actually get the call working
- MainActivity
    - Search Button onClickListener
    - Settings button  
    - Populate Recycler View for saved companies
- activity_main.xml
    - add all necessary text views, etc.
- SearchListActivity
    - finish implementing onListItemClick()

Our application is a simple stock tracking and information app. Users can search for companies on the NYSE, Nasdaq, LSX, Euronext, and other exchanges. As well as saved those cities to be able to quickly view them at a later time.
